## About Me
I am an accounting major at the University of Iowa, and I am looking to work for a public accounting firm upon graduation. Outside of work I enjoy running and am training for a marathon in a couple weeks. I also love traveling and have been to 15 countries, 13 of which I have been in the last 2 years.
